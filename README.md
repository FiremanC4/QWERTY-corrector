# QWERTY-corrector
useful for Cyrillic users when they by mistake forgot to switch languages and typed whole text in Latin.
It takes text from the clipboard and translates it to Cyrillic (first select the wrong text and press Ctrl-X, then run the program).

## Example:

before:
```
Ghbdsn!
```
After:
```
Привіт!
```
